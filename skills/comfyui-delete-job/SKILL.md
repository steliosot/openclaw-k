# ComfyUI Delete Job

Delete or cancel a ComfyUI generation job from the queue.

## When to use this skill

- User asks to "cancel", "stop", or "abort" a generation
- A job appears stuck or is taking too long
- User submitted a job by mistake and wants to cancel it
- Clearing unwanted jobs from the pending queue

## When NOT to use this skill

- You want to check **job progress** → use `comfyui-progress`
- You want to check the **queue** → use `comfyui-queue-status`
- The job has already completed (it's in history, not in queue)
- You want to clear **all** history (this cancels one job at a time)

## Usage

```bash
python3 scripts/run.py <prompt-id>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt_id` | Yes | The prompt ID of the job to cancel |

### Examples

```bash
# Cancel a specific job
python3 scripts/run.py "abc123-def456-789"
```

### Output

JSON object with cancellation result:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "prompt_id": "abc123-def456-789",
  "message": "Job cancelled"
}
```
